        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target="_top" title="css specifications">Media Queries</a> is an enhancement of the @media rules of CSS and the “media” attribute in HTML. It adds parameters such as size of display, color depth and aspect ratio. This is because within a class of media (such as TV sets) there can still be important variations. It is related to the work on CC/PP, but is a much more light-weight and limited solution.
